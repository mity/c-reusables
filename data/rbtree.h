/* This header implements (an intrusive) red-black tree.
 *
 * See e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redâ€“black_tree if you are unfamiliar
 * with the concept of red-black tree.
 *
 * To manipulate or query the tree, the tree as a whole is represented by the
 * RBTREE structure and its nodes are represented by the RBTREE_NODE structure.
 *
 * The word "intrusive" in the title means our RBTREE_NODE structure does not
 * hold any payload data on its own. Instead, you are supposed to embed the
 * node in your own data structure.
 *
 * Also note we do not distinguish any "key" from "data". Caller has to
 * provide his own comparator function for defining the order of the data in
 * the tree and it's up to application to decide which data the node holds
 * serve as the "key", i.e. are used for the ordering.
 *
 * The design decision has some consequences:
 *
 * - To get a pointer to the enclosing application specific data structure, 
 *   use the macro RBTREE_DATA (which is just the the typical "container_of()"
 *   macro implementation.
 *
 * - For some operations like e.g. lookup, the caller has to provide a pointer
 *   to the same dummy structure, initialized enough to serve as the "key" so
 *   the comparator function may do its job.
 *
 * - It also means our implementation actually never allocates/frees any memory
 *   on the heap. All the tree operations like e.g. "insert" or "remove" just
 *   update the pointers in the node structure (and those in other nodes of
 *   the tree).
 *
 *   Caller has to allocate and initialize the payload node structure (which
 *   embeds the RBTREE_NODE) _before_ he inserts it onto the tree (so that the
 *   node can be compared to other nodes in the tree). Similarly, caller is
 *   responsible for freeing any resources the payload structure holds _after_
 *   it is removed from the tree.
 *
 * Note of warning: The RBTREE_NODE stores its color in the least significant
 * bit of the RBTREE_NODE::left pointer. This means that all the RBTREE_NODE
 * instances must be reasonably aligned.

 * nodes and then by re-initializing the tree (i.e. setting its root to NULL)
 * for a potential re-use.
