/* This header implements (intrusive) red-black tree.
 *
 * See e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redâ€“black_tree if you are unfamiliar
 * with the concept of red-black tree.
 *
 * To manipulate or query the tree, the tree as a whole is represented by the
 * RBTREE structure and its nodes are represented by the RBTREE_NODE structure.
 *
 * The word "intrusive" in the title means our RBTREE_NODE structure does not
 * hold any payload data on its own. Instead, you are supposed to embed the
 * node in your own data structure.
 *
 * Also note we do not distinguish any "key" from "data". Caller has to
 * provide his own comparator function for defining the order of the data in
 * the tree and it's up to application to decide which data serve as the "key",
 * i.e. are used for the ordering.
 *
 * The design decision has some consequences:
 *
 * - To get a pointer to the enclosing application specific data structure, 
 *   use the macro RBTREE_DATA (which is just the the typical "container_of()"
 *   macro implementation.
 *
 * - For some operations like e.g. lookup, the caller has to provide a pointer
 *   to the same dummy structure, initialized enough to serve as the "key" so
 *   the comparator function may do its job.
 *
 * - It also means our implementation actually never allocates/frees any memory
 *   on the heap. All the tree operations like e.g. "insert" or "remove" just
 *   update the pointers in the node structure (and those in other nodes of
 *   the tree).
 *
 *   Caller has to allocate and initialize the data structure (at least to the
 *   degree needed by the comparator function) the enclosing data structure
 *   _before_ he inserts it into the tree. Similarly, caller is responsible for
 *   freeing any resources the payload structure holds _after_ it is removed
 *   from the tree.
 *
 * - As long as the node is part of a tree, it must not be modified in any way
 *   which would make the comparator function order it differently with respect
 *   to the other nodes in the tree.
 *
 * Note of warning: The RBTREE_NODE stores its color in the least significant
 * bit of the RBTREE_NODE::left pointer. This means that all the RBTREE_NODE
 * instances must be reasonably aligned.

 * We provide these specialized function for iterating over the nodes in order
 * to destroy them.

 * Note that once the operation starts, the tree must not be used anymore for
 * anything unless it is complete as its internal state gets broken for
 * any other purpose then finishing the clean-up. After the clean-up is
 * completely done, you get a valid empty tree.
 *
 * The function is actually just a specialized light-weight iteration over all
 * nodes, ripping them one by one out from the tree, without any re-balancing.
 *
 * It does not release any resources on its own. (Our implementation does
 * not allocate any at the first place. We only connect the nodes together or
 * as here, disconnect them).
 *
 * I.e., if you are able kill all the nodes more effectively by any other means
 * without iterating over them (for example because all the nodes live in a
 * single memory buffer, which can be freed at once) then you do not need to
 * use this function at all: Instead, simply free the buffer.
 *
 * (Compatibility note: You should not rely on any particular order when using
 * this function. If we find more efficient algorithm for the given purpose,
 * future versions may present the nodes in a different order.)
