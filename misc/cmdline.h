 * Such short option cannot be grouped within single '-abc'. */

/* Enable special compiler-like mode for the long option.
 *
 * Note ::shortname is not supported with this flag. CMDLINE_OPTION::shortname
 * is silently ignored if the flag is used.
 *
 * With this flag, CMDLINE_OPTION::longname is treated differently as follows:
 *
 * 1. The option matches if the CMDLINE_OPTION::longname is the exact prefix
 *   of the argv[i] from commandline.
 *
 * 2. Double dash ("--") is not automatically prepended to
 *    CMDLINE_OPTION::longname. (If you desire any leadin dash, include it
 *    explicitly in CMDLINE_OPTION initialization.)
 *
 * 3. An argument (optionally after a whitespace) is required (the flag
 *    CMDLINE_OPTFLAG_COMPILERLIKE implicitly implies also the flag
 *    CMDLINE_OPTFLAG_REQUIREDARG).
 *
 *    But there is no delimiter expected (no "=" between the option and its
 *    argument). Whitespace is optional between the option and its argument.
 *
 *    Intended use is for options similar to what many compilers accept.
 *    For example:
 *      -DDEBUG=0               (-D is the option, DEBUG=0 is the argument).
 *      -Isrc/include           (-I is the option, src/include is the argument).
 *      -isystem /usr/include   (-isystem is the option, /usr/include is the argument).
 *      -lmath                  (-l is the option, math is the argument).

 *
 *   -- CMDLINE_OPTID_BOGUSARG: The option expects no argument but some
 *      is provided.
 *
 * In all those cases, name of the affected command line option is provided
 * in arg.
